This is an experimental project from my university years.   
The program is written in **C**, using **libsndfile1-dev** library. You can embed secret data (encode) into a sound file, with minimal loss of sound quality (you can not even recognize by listening). After that, you are able to retrieve (decode) the secret content from the encoded file.
